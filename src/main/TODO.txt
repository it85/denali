1. Refactor builders so that they have mandatory fields
2. Refactor CSVParser so that we inject the indices because that should be configurable
3. Clean up the dependency tree (CODE SMELL RIGHT NOW!)
4. Refactor modules for testing, e.g. IndicatorSmokeTest is too tightly coupled with the conf file where the periods are defined. If we changed the periods, then the tests will break.
